# Cumulative Assessment: React Router

*This repo is my solution for the Qualified assessment for 5.6.8.*

*Convert completed web app so that it renders according to URL pathing via React Router and its specialized components. Use Outlet component and index property to make nested routes functional. Supply missing props for components of child routes now rendered via Outlet by leveraging useOutletContext().*
